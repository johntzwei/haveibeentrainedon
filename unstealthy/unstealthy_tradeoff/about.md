This experiment is to test whether for a fixed number of documents that we can perturb, we should use one fixed watermark and repeat it or have a range of different watermarks. 

We decide to test when we have a fixed capacity of watermarking 200 documents. 

Each dataset: the number of documents among 200 documents that uses the same watermark
